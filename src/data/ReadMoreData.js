            April 1861: Prowling the Gulf of Guinea in search of a notorious
            American slaver, U.S.S. Jamestown houses a ship’s company on the
            cusp of disintegration. Festering personal animosities burst into
            the open when the captain is killed. Arriving for repairs at the
            British port of Freetown, the crew hears of Fort Sumter. Political
            tensions explode requiring each officer and man aboard to resolve
            his own conflicting loyalties as Jamestown mimics the nation’s slide
            into sectional conflict. Rather than provoke an international
            incident, Jamestown departs abandoning those of her crew suspected
            of Southern sympathies. Marooned in West Africa, Midshipman Charles
            Sweet and Lieutenant of Marines Aaron Bonney must overcome their
            personal animosities to lead two-dozen Southerners home through
            diplomatic complications, romantic entanglements, local warfare, and
            conflict with the United States Navy. Faced with crises that would
            daunt a commodore, only a combination of dash, courage, quick wits,
            and inconceivable luck can get them home to war.{" "}

            As hostilities escalate in America, the officers of the former slave
            ship Ebony Angel are in a race against time to obtain a cargo of war
            materiel in Great Britain and enter a Southern port before the
            increasingly effective Union Blockade prevents their arrival.
            Inevitably, they become embroiled in the diplomatic and espionage
            activities of North and South, the naval race between Britain and
            France to commission armored warships, the British arms trade, the
            Irish Question, social and romantic entanglements, British politics,
            and a contest with the United States Navy.
