              Welcome to the Navy Gray Series of carefully researched,
              historically accurate novels of the Civil War at Sea. These books
              attempt to reproduce the actual attitudes, conflicts, and
              challenges of the people of the 1860â€™s by immersing the reader in
              the politics, technology, activities, attitudes, and speech
              patterns of the mid-nineteenth century. <br /> Actual persons,
              places, and things are incorporated throughout. General attitudes,
              beliefs, and facts of daily life are authentic as understood by
              the writer.{" "}
